# MineFriff - A Blocky Esolang
**MineFriff** brings the joy of traditional esolangs such as `Befunge` and `><>` into the blocky pixelated world of _Minecraft_.  Much like fungoid languages, MineFriff allows code to be set out in a 2D code area, which can range from a 100*100 grid (allowing for 10,000 instructions) to any size of square (or cube).

As aforementioned, MineFriff allows for free-form code to be written in any size cube (meaning that 3D code is allowed).

## Forms

**MineFriff** comes in three flavours: Strict, Freeform and Textual. _Strict_ MineFriff is contained in a 100 by 100 block grid, and can be exported to a `.mf` file. However, strict MineFriff is only avaliable in the offical MineFriff interpreter world. _Freeform_ MineFriff is avaliable in any world, but is unexportable to an actual file -- code is run using.
```
/py MineFriff
```

_Textual_ MineFriff is a text based ascii version of the blocky esolang, which is avaliable to everyone -- all one needs is the python based MineFriff interpreter.

## Concepts
### Code Box
Like most fungeoidal esolangs, MineFriff has a code box in which the program is placed. In strict MineFriff, this code box is as shown:

![100 * 100 block code grid]()

In freeform MineFriff, this code box is essentially non-existant; programs can take any form they want and can be even 3d.

In textual MineFriff, the code box spans an infinite amount of space, both vertically and horizontally.
